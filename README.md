## Clear macOS Microsoft Office Recents

Microsoft Office 2021 version on macOS still lacks setting toggle to NOT save history of opened files nor clear all recently opened files in a few clicks.

Example of setting on Windows version:

This repo contains scripts + standalone CLI apps coded in multiple programming languages. __All perform the same task of clearing the MS Office recently opened list.__

Programming languges used (in cronological order) consist of:

- Bash
- Go
- C++

***Note***: Script/executable names may be different.

### Technical

This repo/project started with the single need of clearing the recents list. As I started to learn more programming languages, it evolved into an exercise to master the syntax of each language because it covers the following:

- user input/output
- arrays
- logicals
- conditionals
- strings
- functions
- working with files (obtain full path)
- account for errors & invalid inputs
- compile as executable
